## Plugins of the Parking-Pi app:

*Every Cumulocity AngularJs app is a collection of Plugins*

Our Parking-Pi app consists of three main plugins, they are:
* parking-pi-appIcon
* parking-pi-branding
* parking-pi-core

I guess the name of plugins gives some idea about its functionalities ðŸ˜Ž

## Functionalities of our plugins:

**parking-pi-appIcon :**
* This plugin is used to create a logo for your Application.
* To set a unique logo for your application our product Cumulocity will provide you a special angular module.That is given below

```
angular.module('c8y.ui').run(runBlock);

function runBlock(c8yAppIconsList) {
  c8yAppIconsList['yourappcontextpath'] = 'yourappcontextpath'
}

```
and then in your css file you must add

```
.c8y-icon-yourappcontextpath:before {
  content: '';
  background-image: url('youricon.svg');
}

```
* Each angular module will call a REST API at back.
* The above angular module is *not in the cumulocity documentation*. So make use of it.
**You can refer all the available API's in our** [API DOCUMENTATION](http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/jssdk/latest/#/api)

**parking-pi-branding :**
* This plugin is used to change your app's look and feel.
